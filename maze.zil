I would like on behalf of Fiduciary to apologize profusely for the
problems you have been encountering lately. This was due partly to
mysterious computer problems which have suddenly ceased to plague us,
but also to the inability of our staff to show any initiative at all
when confronted with a systems breakdown.|

I have immediately initiated a training program to counteract this
ridiculous bureaucracy, and trust that in your future dealings with
Fiduciary you will have no cause for complaint.|
|
By way of compensation I have waived all interest and administration
charges for this quarter, and would also like you to accept this free
first-class ticket to Paris.|
|
I also enclose your check book and a new Gold Beezer card and have
raised your credit limit to $10,000.|

Sincerely yours,|
